# LeetCode Problem Tracker

A GitHub Pages-based application to track your LeetCode problem-solving progress and store notes.

## Setup Instructions

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Under "Source", select the main branch and click Save
4. Your site will be published at `https://{your-username}.github.io/{repo-name}`

## Usage

1. Visit your GitHub Pages URL
2. On first use, you'll be prompted for:
   - A GitHub Personal Access Token (needs `repo` scope)
   - Your repository name (in format `username/repository`)
3. Check off problems as you complete them
4. Add notes in the text areas - they'll be automatically saved to both:
   - Your browser's local storage
   - Your GitHub repository under the `notes/` directory

## Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name and select the `repo` scope
4. Copy the token and keep it safe - you'll need it when using the app

## Privacy Note

Your notes are stored in your GitHub repository. Make sure your repository is private if you want to keep your notes private.
